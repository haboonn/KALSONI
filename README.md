# KALSONI
A blockchain based rideshare service 
Kalsoni (trust in Somali) is a peer-to-peer carpooling application. As we know it, most carpooling systems are in the control of one agency. You can create a smart contract that would connect the rider and driver directly without the intervention of any third party like Uber or LYFT. Agencies like Uber and Ola have all the data of drivers as well as of riders and this can lead to major privacy issues. If somehow, ride-sharing and car hire are moved to blockchain then we can build a much more secure and reliable carpooling system
